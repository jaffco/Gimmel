# Gimmel Effects Benchmark Results Summary

## Test Suite Overview

We've successfully created a comprehensive benchmarking suite for all gimmel audio effects with two complementary approaches:

### 1. Micro-Benchmark (`micro_benchmark.cpp`)
- **Purpose**: Isolated performance testing of individual effects
- **Iterations**: 100,000 per `processSample` test, 1,000 per `setParams` test
- **Focus**: Pure computational performance without I/O overhead

### 2. Full Audio Processing Benchmark (`test.cpp`)
- **Purpose**: Real-world performance testing with actual audio files
- **Features**: Effects chain processing, real-time factor calculation
- **Focus**: Practical audio processing performance

## Performance Results

### Individual Effect Performance (from micro-benchmark):

| Effect      | setParams (ns) | processSample (ns) | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Biquad**  | 150            | 31                | Configurable filter |
| **Chorus**  | 29             | 40                | Very efficient |
| **Compressor** | 42          | 34                | Very efficient |
| **Delay**   | 49             | 28                | Very efficient |
| **Detune**  | 27             | 30                | Very efficient |
| **EnvelopeFilter** | 26      | 64                | Moderate processing cost |
| **Expander** | 23            | 23                | Very efficient |
| **Flanger** | 26             | 24                | Very efficient |
| **Phaser**  | 23             | 80                | Moderate processing cost |
| **Reverb**  | 403            | 361               | Most computationally expensive |
| **Saturation** | N/A         | 25                | Very efficient |
| **Tremolo** | 21             | 23                | Very efficient |

### Real-Time Processing Results:

- **Audio File**: Gmaj.wav (139,878 samples)
- **Average Processing Time**: 400 ns per sample
- **Real-Time Factor**: 52.08x faster than real-time
- **Effects Chain**: Reverb → Delay → Chorus

## Key Insights

### 1. Performance Hierarchy
- **Heavy**: Reverb (361 ns/sample) - Complex algorithm with multiple comb filters and APFs
- **Moderate**: Phaser (80 ns/sample), EnvelopeFilter (64 ns/sample) - Dynamic parameter updates
- **Light**: All other effects (~23-40 ns/sample) - Simple processing algorithms

### 2. Real-Time Capability
- **Excellent headroom**: 52.08x real-time factor means the system can handle:
  - Many effects in parallel
  - Higher sample rates
  - Additional processing overhead

### 3. Parameter Update Costs
- **Reverb setParams**: 403 ns (expensive room calculations)
- **Biquad setParams**: 150 ns (coefficient recalculation)
- **Other effects**: 21-49 ns (simple parameter assignments)

## Build System

The test suite includes automated build scripts:
- `build_micro_benchmark.sh` - Quick isolated testing
- `build_and_run_benchmark.sh` - Full audio processing test

Both compile with optimization flags (`-O3 -DNDEBUG`) for accurate performance measurements.

## Technical Notes

- **Compiler**: g++ with C++17 standard
- **Platform**: macOS with Apple Silicon/Intel
- **Test Input**: 0.5 (mid-range signal level)
- **Sample Rate**: 48,000 Hz (professional audio standard)

## Recommendations

1. **For real-time applications**: All effects are suitable with significant headroom
2. **For low-latency applications**: Prefer lighter effects (avoid multiple reverbs)
3. **For parameter automation**: Reverb parameter changes should be limited in frequency
4. **For effect chains**: Current performance allows 10+ effects in real-time

The benchmark suite provides a solid foundation for performance regression testing and optimization validation during development.
